          <h2>What drives me</h2>
          <p>Music sharpened my ear for detail and structure. Coding gave me a toolkit to build ideas. Cybersecurity adds responsibility—understanding systems deeply so they remain trustworthy.</p>
          <p>I like projects where I can ship something tangible, learn a new concept, and explain it clearly to others. You’ll see that in my logic gate build, where hardware meets digital theory.</p>
