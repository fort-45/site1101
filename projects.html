            <h2>Building logic gates on breadboards</h2>
            <p>We explored how hardware works by building NOT, AND, OR, and XOR gates using breadboards, transistors, LEDs, and buttons. The build connected digital logic concepts with real hardware behavior, and I documented the full process in a video.</p>
